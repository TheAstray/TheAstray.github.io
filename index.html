        <h4>A MOONLIGHTNIGHT</h4>
        <p>
          The album resembles drifting away into sleep and every song is a different dream. Its about sleeping at the edge of dreams and nightmares between melancolic romanticism, reflecting the past and the tales of the dark.
          With songs that capture the emotional depths of falling in love, trying to stand up after getting thrown to the ground and learning from lessons of the past. <br>

        <h4>THE ASTRAY</h4>
        <p>
          The Astray is an indi-Rockband with a modern take on romanticism and an old-fashioned garage rock-selfmade feeling.
Settled in the mid-west of Germany, the Band formed in 2020 out of two former student bands of Lukas Raschke (Lead-Singer and Guitarist), Marco D'Anna (Pianist and second Guitarist), Matthias Rudnik (Drummer), Leon Schneider (Bassist) and Tobias Döhling (background management and concept artist) joined the band in 2022, was highly inspired by their Idols reaching from bands like Queen to MCR, to FallOutBoy and even Bring Me The Horizon. But the sound of the Band can't be described with just one genre. It's fluctuating and unpredictable, like a Dream. Thus the Idea for "A Moonlight Night" was born. The Album is a representation of the different Dreams of a Moonlight Night and the different sound the Band has to offer, from Hard Rock, to Acoustic Songs and Classic-Rock-Ballads.

             Oh, let us get emotional tonight <br>
        Let us believe, let us cry, let us try again <br>
                The irrational high price <br>
         For a moonlight night, a moonlight night <br>
                      [...] <br>
            <br>
            "Moonlight Night" is the titel giving song of the Album. <br>
             It takes you out on a walk through the night, next to the river and into the woods. <br>
              As the dark surrounds you, you hold on to the person you love and promise to never leave their side, hoping to suvive those dark times together.

            Welcome to the circus <br>

            <br>
            Welcome to the Jungle is a metaphor for growing up into our perverted society. 
            The song is about breaking the patterns of a perverted/sick reality, breaking out of one’s cage and letting the “animal” out, so everyone can see what they are really dealing with. 
            It's a song about one’s true nature, about emancipation, <br> 
            about showing what is deep down inside of us. <br>
            <br>
            It's about our deepest - and in this case - darkest desires.

                      [...] <br>
          My love is like a Molotov cocktail on ice <br>
          If it breaks out you should run and hide <br>
          But If you wanna play with fire then you gotta come to me <br>
          And If it's that what you desire I'm the match and you're the gasoline <br>
                      [...] <br>
            <br>
            "Molotov Love" is a little bit different from the previous songs. It shows the rougher and more passionate sides of love. Because if there is the fire of love, you can burn yourself with it. After all love is about taking risks, so "if your love would be riot, oh then I'd be throwing stones".

            <br>
            "Emerald Eyes" was written in love for a mysterious person. <br>
            Mysterious eyes, an mysterious personality and an old nemesis called Idealization lead to this song. It's about wanting to look behind the fassade and about getting to know someone untouchable. The song was written for a person that was "fucking with my brain" for a long time, but after all I "fucked" with my own brain enough myself, leading to an unpleasent end.

            <br>
            Incredible is a classic teenage love song. <br>
             It's full of cringey love declarations, because the song wants to express the feeling of invincibility one experiences while being in love. When you are in love, knowing of their love for you and the sole existence of your person make you feel incredible and that is what this song is all about.

            <br>
            "Neon Pink" is the melancholic take on the impact that one person can have on your life. You emotionally connect everything you experience to this Person, while you love them, but once your paths part, those connections become either tainted pink with nostalgia, or dark grey in remorse and bitterness.

            <br>
            "Sleeping Issues" is about unfinished business. It's about holding on to a long lost love, which you can't let go. This song is a bittersweet example of a broken person, who isn't ready to accept their faith. It should be used as an example of how not to behave after a break up, because it is a waste of energy and time to let your life be dictated by such false beliefs. Don't fall for it, but stand up and live.

            "Crooked Little Trees" is a realization. It's a tale of the morals our society dictates us and about the way of thinking, which is empowered by the media and the public. It is a statement against our shallow way of thinking. Growing up with so many superficial realities, one has to really learn what real values are and how life is lived the right way.

          You greet my love and my power fades <br>

            Made of Tears” is like a cry. A cry for our strongest desires: love, trust, and everlasting loyalty. <br>
            This song describes not only a process, or the story of a romantic journey. It’s a chest keeping my emotions, my wishes, and desires inside. This chest was mostly shaped by the last few months, which dug me a seemingly bottomless pit, that I can’t escape, held back by the love I have lost. The song is drenched in dreary melancholy, my loyal companion constantly staying at my side while I’m drowning in past times. <br> 
            This song is like following the metaphorical invitation described in Queen’s “Dreamers Ball”: <br>
            “If I can’t have you when I’m waking; I go to sleep and dream I’m with you” <br>
            But this ball is like a prison where I’m waiting to be rescued. Waiting for true love to come for me, to heal my wounds and help me through the sinister night. <br>
            It’s a cry of all the souls, doomed by love to sink into the depths of solence, hoping that the last light in the dark won’t die. <br>
            <br>
            We loved this Queen classic, but after everything that happened, I can’t stand listening to this song anymore. I never wanted us to end up dancing at the ball and I’m sorry that it had to end that way. <br>
            <br>
            Farewell, my dear Aries. Thank you for giving me the feeling of being loved by someone <br>
