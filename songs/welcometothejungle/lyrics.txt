[Verse] 

Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the world
I know you felt the rumble
That's going through the land. 

Get up and let the show begin
Show me what you got
Release the animal within
Release your other side 

[Hook] 

And the crowd goes:
Rum dumdum rum dadadadadada rumdumdada 

[Verse 2] 

Welcome to the Circus
Welcome to your new home
They got everything you needed
But you didn't even know 

Come closer take a step ahead
You are their favourite prisoner
They're watching you like demons
Attracted irresistible 

[Hook] 

And your heart beats:
rum bum bum bumbumbadamdamrumbumbumbadadum 

[Bridge] 

Oh I know you feel this desire driving you insane, this
Wildfire spreading through your veins, this
Satire that your life became, this
Amplifier for your deepest pain and 

Those dreams of brutality, let
Them be your reality, 
Sharpen your claws and show your teeth
The blood pumps of the blood stream 

[Climax] 

Let the animal reveal
Bite them scratch them let, them feel
How it feels to drown in tears
What it means to live in fear
