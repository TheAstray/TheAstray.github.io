My love is dangerous
For me and everyone else
And if you're scared of the dark
In the night I'm your spark 
To ignite 
Your heart 

My heart is venomous
It is poisened and your heart it is the antidote
Would you be so generous, give me all your tenderness and I give you everything


[Pre-Chorus] 

And if your love would be a riot, oh then I'd be throwing stones
If you set the sky on fire, oh then I will light the clouds
If you gonna bring the chaos you will never be alone
And we will go on 'til there's noone to dethrone

[Chorus] 

My love is like a Molotov cocktail on ice
If it breaks out you should run and hide
But If wanna play with fire then you gotta come to me
And If it's that what you desire I'm the match and you're the gasoline 

[Verse] 

Your love is murderous
You've poisend me so effortless
You've got my heart in your hand
And I can't even tell 
What you want from me 

Your love is obnoxious
But tastes like wine
With a little bit of poison
That's what I like
You are the eternal flame in my everfrost
And you are melting my heart but at what cost?


Cause, you are setting me free
But are you sure, 
That you can tame the beast? 

[Chorus] 

My love's a Molotov cocktail on ice
If it breaks out you should run and hide
But If wanna play with fire then you gotta come to me
And If it's that what you desire I'm the match and you the gasoline
