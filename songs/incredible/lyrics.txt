[Verse]


What is feeling inside my chest 
It's beating faster, beating faster, it is beating me dead, (and) I have a guess 

Oh I have met you, some weeks ago
And I don't know, yeah I don't know, Oh I don't even know, 
your favourite show 

[Pre-Chorus] 

And as the time goes past in the blink of an eye
I'm talking still fast by the of the night
Cause I need you more than sleep 

And as the day goes on and I think of you
All my worries gone (the) only thing to 
Is to talk to you all night long 

[Chorus] 

You're making me feel big, mountains tall
You're making me feel special
All you need is talk and I fade away
Cause you are making me feel,
Incredible! 

[Verse] 

Oh yeah this feeling, don't know it's name
Cause after all, yeah after all my love is still a game, turned on and off 

Maybe I'm rushing but that' just me
But listen close, yeah listen close, oh listen close to me
To my words 

[Bridge] 

All your flaws are making you better 
If you're cold you can have my sweater
And in my eyes there could never
Be someone like you


[Chorus] 

You're making me feel big, mountains tall
You're making me feel special
All you need is talk and I fade away
Cause you are making me feel 
Incredible!
