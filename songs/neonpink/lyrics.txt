[Verse] 

Oh I've been down
So many bottles 
About to drown
In my sweet sorrow 

And as I slowly got the feels again
A smile it hit my face my friend
I think I need help
And as we're dancing all night long to our favourite song
I know I must be dreaming because I can't even dance 

[Chorus] 

But I have the right
Have the right to miss you!
I have the right to shed a tear when I smell your perfume, but it isn't you
I have the right to crave your touch
I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me
Even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself
But neither can I without you
Neither can I without you 

[Bridge] 

Oh and I know I'm not making it better
I'm making it worse
But when the remote is stuck on pause
No applause and nothing but silence after all
Of course I'll be wanting more 

But I am insatiable full of love
But don't you worry please it's enough in anyway
Cause you got your problems, so do I 
And I am hard to love because I'm quite the romantic
That can be overwhelming 

But til I can tell you 

[Chorus] 

I have the right
Have the right to miss you
I have the right to shed a tear when I smell  your perfume but it isn't you
I have the right to crave your touch
I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself
But neither can I without you
Neither can I without you
Sleeping Issues
[Hook] 

And oh I'm headed downtown, 
To the places that I love
The place I once loved
But they're tainted pink 

And oh I'm divin' deep down
Oh I'm diving to the ground
And everything that you left to sink
Is tainted neon pink 

[Verse] 

And now that we are mixing colours
And I see you 
With your bloodred lips 
Lick your fingertips 

And though I'm always on the run
I'm running from you
Because the bittersweet pain
Stops the deep green paint to drain 

[Verse pt. 2] 

And I wear nostalgia as my make up
Oh there's no chance to make up
For everything that you left in me, I'm 
Drowning in another cup
Drown in another love
That I am painting with my masochistic mastermind
And when I wear my rose coloured glasses
I'm seeing rose coloured ashes 
Of the burned down house
Of our past time vows
I'm burning in red hot passion
I haven't learned my lesson
When you play with fire
Don't you bring the gasoline 

[Hook] 

And oh I'm headed downtown, 
To the places that I love
The place I once loved
But they're tainted pink 

And oh I'm divin' deep down
Oh I'm diving to the ground
And everything that you left to sink
Is tainted neon pink 

[Verse] 

And oh I'm, I'm reeking from the chemicals
That burn me deep down in my bones, in my soul, I
Can't push you from that pedestal
That I put you on such long time ago (2x) 

[Hook] 

And oh I'm headed downtown, 
To the places that I love
The place I once loved
But they're tainted pink 

And oh I'm divin' deep down
Oh I'm diving to the ground
And everything that you left to sink
Is tainted neon pink
