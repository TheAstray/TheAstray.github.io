[Intro] 

Run away from your greatest fears
Wipe away all the wasted tears
You can't show
What a show 

Hide your face hide you whole despair
Hide the pain let it disappear
In your eyes
In the night 

[Verse] 

Wander off next to the river but don't go off the moonlit way
Because oh sweet heartbroken Hunter you are nothing but the prey 
For the demons that are waiting for you luring in the dark
Waiting for the moment that you lose your last path
And lose your spark that will never reignite
The fire never tired of the spark of life 

[Pre-Chorus] 

But the demons found their way in your heart
Pushing you into the flood out of the dark
And you are drowning drowning sinking to the ground
But I will get you out out out out out
I will get you out 

[Chorus] 

Let us get emotional tonight
Let us believe, let us cry, let us try again
The irrational high price
For a moonlight night, a moonlight night 

Let me take an oath before you and our ghosts 
That I will not leave your side 
In this moonlight night 

[Bridge] 

And Oh I'm going crazy
Oh I'm going crazy
I'm losing my, losing my, losing my mind 

And Oh I crave you baby
Oh I crave you baby
I crave touch, crave your love, crave your heart 

Oh I am sick of it, sick of it
Sick of swallowing, swallowing
All that I'm feeling deep down to my bones
My heart beats quicker than it's ever been
The stars are flickering flickering 
And I start to scream! 

[Chorus] 

Let us get emotional tonight
Let us believe, let us cry, let us try again
The irrational high price
For a moonlight night, a moonlight night 

Let me take an oath
Before you and our ghosts
That I will not leave your side 
In this moonlight night 

Let me take you in like the pills you're swallowing
Change the trouble for delight
