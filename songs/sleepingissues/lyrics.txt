[Verse] 

Oh I've been down
So many bottles 
About to drown
In my sweet sorrow 

And as I slowly got the feels again
A smile it hit my face my friend
I think I need help
And as we're dancing all night long to our favourite song
I know I must be dreaming because I can't even dance 

[Chorus] 

But I have the right
Have the right to miss you!
I have the right to shed a tear when I smell your perfume, but it isn't you
I have the right to crave your touch
I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me
Even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself
But neither can I without you
Neither can I without you 

[Bridge] 

Oh and I know I'm not making it better
I'm making it worse
But when the remote is stuck on pause
No applause and nothing but silence after all
Of course I'll be wanting more 

But I am insatiable full of love
But don't you worry please it's enough in anyway
Cause you got your problems, so do I 
And I am hard to love because I'm quite the romantic
That can be overwhelming 

But til I can tell you 

[Chorus] 

I have the right
Have the right to miss you
I have the right to shed a tear when I smell  your perfume but it isn't you
I have the right to crave your touch
I have the right to miss you sleeping next to me even though sleeping next to me means I can't sleep myself
But neither can I without you
Neither can I without you
