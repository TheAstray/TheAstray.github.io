Can you see, the rain is falling on my weary face; 
Surrounded by the cold, trapped at this place 
Im standing here, I’m standing there but I just cannot see 
The friend who can/will release and be the home for me 

Tonight the sky is sparkling nice, no darker clouds are seen 
The wind is blowing through the leaves, creating calm and peace	
But the one is missing, the one is missing who shows me something rife 
The one who’s standing close to me and staying at my side 

When the sun goes down, but no moonlight shines 
Take me by the hand, lead me through this night 
Join my way and promise/swear me [ensure me] that you try to keep this lines 
And try to sing along to the song of our lives 

As soon as I (just) return home 
I can‘t resist  ´cause now I’m alone 
My feigned mask it starts to fall 
The dusk begins, I‘m forced to crawl/and lets me crawl 
I drown in my tangled mind and my heart it strains to find 
All the cheery things  I left behind 

So far I used to spend my time 
For other souls and selling mine 
Such a bleaky place/spot to live (at) 
Where everyone forgives 
You greet my love and my power fades 
My deeds were all betrayed 
Finding the guilt is in vain 

I walk through time and barely/hardly mind 
Days and weeks/How weeks are passsing by 
Our music stopped in the dance hall 
We’re dancing at the Dreamers Ball/So take me to the Dreamers Ball 
God, I need you by my side 
I need  my saving light 
Then again/only then this/the stars are shining bright 

But I know I have to let you go 

Where are you? 
My Dear 
I lost you 
In our sorrow and our fear 
How are you? 
Do not forget our love/affection 
How we cherished/valued our care and reached the stars above/in love and protection 

I miss you/Where are you? 
I dont want us to be apart 
Come and sing along to the song of our hearts
