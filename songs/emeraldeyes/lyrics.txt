[Verse] 

Oh I wanna look into this head of yours
Cause I wanna know for sure
If there's a demon hiding behind your blonde fassade 

Look behind these emerald eyes
To look if you're telling lies
Cause I can't read the words when I try to read your face 

[Pre-Chorus] 

Cause oh my god you are my metal queen 
Let me be your king and imma give everything
Oh dear lord you are a valkyrie
And I will fight for you or go to valhalla as I die
So I will fight cause I only see you on the battlefiele 

[Chorus] 

Oh let me melt your armor
Made of blue ice
Just give another
Look with your emerald eyes
Imma be your amor
Will you be my valentine
Oh please give me another
Look with your two emerald eyes 

[Verse] 

Oh I wanna look into this heart of your's
Cause I wanna know for sure
If there is room for me for all my love and even more 

Wanna look into your mortal soul
Because I just wanna know
What secrets you are hiding from the sunlight after all 

[Pre-Chorus] 

Cause oh my god you're driving me insane
Waking up at 4 AM just crying out your name girl 
Oh dear lord you're fucking with my brain
The thought of us turns on and off with ever word you say
